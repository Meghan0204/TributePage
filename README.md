# Tribute Page

A responsive tribute page created as part of my **Responsive Web Design Certification** from FreeCodeCamp.org. This project demonstrates my ability to build structured, styled, and accessible web pages using core front‑end technologies.

## Overview

This repository contains the source files for a **tribute page** dedicated to a historical figure and built with HTML and CSS. The page is designed with semantic HTML structure and styled for readability and responsiveness. This type of project is common in front‑end development to practice layout, content organization, and visual design. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Features

✔ Responsive layout for multiple screen sizes  
✔ Navigation and readable content sections  
✔ Custom styling using CSS

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for content structure and semantic markup  
- **CSS3** – for layout, styling, and responsive design

## How It Works

- **`index.html`** provides the main page structure including headers, content sections, and images.  
- **`styles.css`** defines styling rules for layout, typography, and responsiveness.  
- The project uses plain HTML and CSS, focusing on solid foundational skills in web design without JavaScript or frameworks.

This project highlights the ability to create clear and user‑friendly web pages, an essential part of front‑end development.
